# EEG_thesis
The code in this repo was used to collect data sets and produce the results for the master thesis "Emotion Detection from Electroencephalography Data with Machine Learning; Classification of emotions elicited by auditory stimuli from music on self-collected data sets." by Filip SÃ¶derqvist.

A few samples from the single subject data set has been provided in order to run the demo files.

To run the demo examples simply clone the repo and run the scripts in a terminal, e.g.:

python demo_nn.py
